            The Repository Mirroring Tool (RMT) for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP2 allows enterprise customers to optimize the management of SUSE Linux Enterprise software updates and subscription entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for SUSEÂ® Customer Center with repositories and registration targets. This helps you to centrally manage software updates within a firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining your corporate security policies and regulatory compliance.
            RMT allows you to provision updates for all of your devices running a product based on SUSE Linux Enterprise. By downloading these updates once and distributing them throughout the enterprise, you can set more restrictive firewall policies. This also reduces bandwidth usage, as there is no need to download the same updates for each device. RMT is fully supported and available as a download for customers with an active SUSE Linux Enterprise product subscription.Please view our <a href="#" >guide</a> to assist you in the RMT installation process.
